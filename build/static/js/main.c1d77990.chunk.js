We know that mothers who continuously use a doula have a higher chance of a spontaneous vaginal birth and are less likely to have pain medication, less likely to have instrumental assisted births, and less likely to have negative feelings about birth. With this in mind, we come ready to help families educate and advocate for themselves on this amazing journey."})})]})})},m=t(15),b=t.p+"static/media/briannaNew.31d16935.jpeg",u=t.p+"static/media/familyImage.2a17a931.jpeg",j=function(){return Object(h.jsx)("div",{children:Object(h.jsxs)("div",{className:"about-container",children:[Object(h.jsx)(m.Parallax,{className:"brianna-image",bgImage:b,strength:500}),Object(h.jsx)("div",{className:"about-section-two",children:Object(h.jsx)("div",{className:"about-text-container",children:Object(h.jsxs)("div",{className:"about-para-container",children:[Object(h.jsxs)("div",{className:"qualification-container",children:[Object(h.jsx)("h3",{className:"brianna-name-title",children:"Hello, I\u2019m Brianna Lovelace!"}),Object(h.jsx)("h4",{className:"qualification",children:"Doula Certificate"}),Object(h.jsx)("h4",{className:"qualification",children:"Childbirth Educator Certificate"}),Object(h.jsx)("h4",{className:"qualification",children:"Lactation Specialist Certificate"}),Object(h.jsx)("h4",{className:"qualification",children:"Baby Wearing Educator Certificate"}),Object(h.jsx)("h4",{className:"qualification",children:"Placenta Specialist Certificate"})]}),Object(h.jsx)("p",{className:"about-text-one",children:"I have a heart to support birthing and postpartum mothers.
