Having a doula is statistically proven to improve birth outcomes. \n                    We know that mothers who continuously use a doula have a higher chance of a spontaneous \n                    vaginal birth and are less likely to have pain medication, less likely to have instrumental assisted births, \n                    and less likely to have negative feelings about birth. With this in mind, we come ready to help \n                    families educate and advocate for themselves on this amazing journey.</p>\n                </div>\n            </section>\n        </div>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default Home;","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/briannaNew.31d16935.jpeg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/familyImage.2a17a931.jpeg\";","import React from 'react';\nimport { Parallax } from 'react-parallax';\n\n// import images\nimport briannaImage from '../../images/briannaNew.jpeg';\nimport familyImage from '../../images/familyImage.jpeg';\n\nconst About = () => {\n    return (\n        <div>\n            <div className=\"about-container\">\n                <Parallax className=\"brianna-image\" bgImage={ briannaImage } strength={500}></Parallax>\n                <div className=\"about-section-two\">\n                <div className=\"about-text-container\">\n                    <div className=\"about-para-container\">\n                    <div className=\"qualification-container\">\n                        <h3 className=\"brianna-name-title\">Hello, I’m Brianna Lovelace!</h3>\n                        <h4 className=\"qualification\">Doula Certificate</h4>\n                        <h4 className=\"qualification\">Childbirth Educator Certificate</h4>\n                        <h4 className=\"qualification\">Lactation Specialist Certificate</h4>\n                        <h4 className=\"qualification\">Baby Wearing Educator Certificate</h4>\n                        <h4 className=\"qualification\">Placenta Specialist Certificate</h4>\n                    </div>\n\n                        <p className=\"about-text-one\">I have a heart to support birthing and postpartum mothers. \n                        After marrying my highschool sweetheart, earning my Bachleor’s degree in psychology and becoming pregnant \n                        with our first child, I became interested in becoming a doula. \n                        I later trained at the Indie Birth Association, which emphasizes autonomous and natural birthing practices, \n                        as well as Uzazi Village, which prioritizes birth assistance for black and brown families. \n                        These Associations have given me unique experiences to better serve families. \n                        I’m so grateful for my supportive husband, with whom I now have 3 young children, \n                        or encouraging me to pursue my dreams. In my free time I love to spend time with my family, \n                        homeschool my children, go to church with my family, read the Word, work on handcrafts, garden, \n                        explore the outdoors (kids and dirt were made for each other!) and continue my birth work education \n                        to become a midwife one day.</p>\n\n                        <p className=\"about-text-two\">When I was pregnant with my oldest, \n                        I was fortunate to have a doula support me through his birth.

Not everyone has that experience, but I am grateful she was there to guide \n                        the process and advocate for me. For my second birth, I decided I needed to freebirth and I had my baby at home with my husband. \n                        I had a great experience at home and went on to birth the same way for my third baby.</p>\n\n                        <p className=\"about-text-three\">It was after I had my second child that I finally decided to step out and become a doula. \n                        I saw that our natural-minded, freebirth & BIPOC communities need more birthing support during this amazing season of pregnancy. \n                        Black women have a higher c-section rate and both women and their babies have a much higher mortality when not using a doula for support. \n                        I want to help influence those positive outcomes and support mothers and fathers through the process.</p>\n\n                        <p className=\"about-text-four\">I can’t wait to learn more about you! \n                        Please reach out to schedule a free consultation so \n                        that we can better get to know each other & see if we might be a good fit.</p>\n                        {/* <Parallax className=\"family-image\" bgImage={ familyImage } strength={500}></Parallax> */}\n                        <div className=\"family-image-container\">\n                            <img alt=\"family\" className=\"family-image\" src={familyImage}></img>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default About;","import React from 'react';\n\nfunction Servicedropdown() {\n    return (\n        <div>\n            <div className=\"menu\">\n\n                {/* Menu item one */}\n                <li className=\"item\" id='birthdoula'>\n                    <a href='#birthdoula' className=\"menu-link\">+ Birth Doula</a>\n                    <div className=\"imenu\">\n                        <p>\n                            Establishing client relationship and determining birthing preferences and the best ways I can support you and your family before, during and after birth, as well as educating your partner on your specific coping mechanisms and your preferred comfort measures.
